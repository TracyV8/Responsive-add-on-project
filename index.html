            <h3>Why Perth, WA?</h3>
            <h2>Perth, Australia's sunniest capital! ðŸŒž</h2>
            <p>
              Perth is situated on the west bank of the Swan River and was
              founded in 1829. It grew due to the convicts arrival around the
              labour shortage, with many of the major buildings built by the
              convicts. The city boomed during the 1890's gold discovery.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perth is home to the largest inland park in the world! Thatâ€™s
              right! Kings Park, which sits proudly beside the Swan River within
              stones throw of the CBD, is actually the largest inland park IN
              THE WORLD. It is larger than Central Park in New York, and Hyde
              Park in London. Now, thatâ€™s one of the facts about Perth that most
              people donâ€™t know! In size, it covers over 400 hectares, and is
              home to the War Memorial, Tennis Club, a reservoir, and more
              plants and flowers than you could poke a stick at!
